# ✅ Git & GitHub: End-of-Chapter Checklist

Here’s a list of everything you should know by the end of this chapter. If all of this makes sense, congratulations. You’re officially less likely to scream into the void next time Git gets weird.

If not? No worries, Git is basically a relationship: it gets easier once you stop trying to control everything and just communicate better.

### 🧠 The Basics

- [ ] I can explain what **Git** is and why it exists (hint: not just for hoarders).
- [ ] I understand what **GitHub** is and how it’s different from Git.
- [ ] I know what **version control** means and why even solo devs should care.

---

### 🧮 Core Concepts

- [ ] I get the difference between a **local repo** and a **remote repo**.
- [ ] I know what a **commit** is and why it’s basically a save point for my project.
- [ ] I understand the **staging area** and why Git makes me jump through this extra hoop.
- [ ] I know what `HEAD` is and how it points to where I’m currently working.

---

### 🧭 Working with Git

- [ ] I’ve used the core Git commands:
  - [ ] `git init`
  - [ ] `git status`
  - [ ] `git add`
  - [ ] `git commit`
  - [ ] `git log`
  - [ ] `git diff`
- [ ] I know what a **branch** is and why I shouldn't do everything on `main`.
- [ ] I can **merge** branches and know what to do when Git says “Merge conflict 💥”.
- [ ] I’ve resolved a **merge conflict** and lived to tell the tale.

---

### 🛠️ Collaborating with GitHub

- [ ] I know the difference between **cloning**, **forking**, and **pulling** (they’re not the same).
- [ ] I’ve run:
  - [ ] `git clone` to bring a remote repo to my machine
  - [ ] `git pull` to get the latest from the remote
  - [ ] `git push` to send my work up to GitHub
- [ ] I understand what a **Pull Request (PR)** is and why it's more than just a glorified "Submit" button.

---

### 🧱 Git Hygiene & Best Practices

- [ ] I write **clear, meaningful commit messages** (no more “fix stuff” x10).
- [ ] I commit early, commit often. No commits with 78 different features.
- [ ] I know how to use **`.gitignore`** to avoid uploading secrets, logs, or my cat pictures.
- [ ] I understand what `git revert` and `git reset` do and when _not_ to use them.
- [ ] I know how to recover from mistakes without nuking my repo from orbit (hello `git log`, `git checkout`, `git reflog`).

---

### 💡 Bonus Thinking Tools

- [ ] I understand that Git is basically a **time machine** for my code. Doc Brown would be proud.
- [ ] I’m okay with messing up. Git is confusing at first, but I don’t panic (as much).
- [ ] I can sketch out or explain how **branching and merging** work — even to a rubber duck.

If you can check off most of these, you're officially Not A Git Noob™.  
Still confused? That’s normal. Keep practicing, mess things up, and don’t be afraid to Google like your life depends on it.  
Git gets easier with time (and therapy).
