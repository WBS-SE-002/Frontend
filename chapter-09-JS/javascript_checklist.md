# ✅ JavaScript (and a dash of Tailwind): End-of-Chapter Checklist

Here’s a list of everything you should know by the end of this short (but sweet) chapter.  
If you’re checking these off with confidence, congrats, your brain is now at least 30% more JavaScript-flavored. (I'm sorry)

If not? No biggie. JS is full of quirks, but the more you poke at it, the less it bites. Sorta.

---

### 🧠 The Basics

- [ ] I can explain what **JavaScript** is and where it runs (hint: not just in the browser anymore).
- [ ] I know what **Tailwind** is and why it’s a fast way to write styling, even if it doesn't feel that fast yet.
- [ ] I understand the difference between **ES5 and ES6+**, and why newer syntax makes life easier (and weirder).

---

### 🧮 Variables & Data

- [ ] I know when to use `let` vs `const` vs `var`, and why `var` is the weird uncle we don’t invite anymore.
- [ ] I understand the difference between **primitives** (like numbers and strings) and **objects** (like arrays and functions).
- [ ] I use **template literals** (backticks) instead of messy string + concatenation.
- [ ] I get what **arrays** are, how they’re just fancy objects under the hood, and why that can be a little trippy coming from Python.
- [ ] I understand **objects**: key/value pairs, dot vs bracket notation, and how deeply nested chaos can get.

---

### 🧭 Control Flow

- [ ] I know the difference between `==` and `===`, and why `===` should be my default.
- [ ] I can write **conditionals** using `if`, `else`, `else if`, and the occasional ternary for good measure.
- [ ] I can loop with `for`, `while`, and `for...of`, and know which one to use and when.

---

### 🛠️ Functions & Methods

- [ ] I can write functions using **declarations**, **expressions**, and **arrow functions**. I know when arrow functions might betray me (thanks, `this`).
- [ ] I understand **higher-order functions**, and I’m not afraid of functions that take or return other functions.
- [ ] I can use these built-in array methods like a pro:
  - [ ] `forEach()` – when I just want to _do_ stuff
  - [ ] `map()` – when I want to _transform_ stuff
  - [ ] `filter()` – when I want to _keep_ some stuff
  - [ ] `find()` – when I want to find _just one_ thing
  - [ ] `reduce()` – when I feel like living dangerously (but also doing some powerful stuff)

---

### 🧱 Built-in Objects & the Console

- [ ] I use `console.log()` like a flashlight in the dark — and I know about other tools like `console.error()`, `console.table()`, etc.
- [ ] I know what the **`window`** object is, and why basically everything in browser-land lives on it.

---

### 💡 Bonus Thinking Tools

- [ ] I understand that "everything is an object" in JS is a helpful half-truth except for when it isn’t (looking at you, `null` and `undefined`).
- [ ] I accept that JavaScript is a little weird and buggy by nature. That’s part of its charm.
- [ ] I’ve tried explaining these concepts to a classmate or a rubber duck. If the duck gets it, so do I.

If you can check these off, congrats. You’ve got a solid JavaScript foundation.

Still foggy on some stuff? That’s totally normal. Just keep experimenting, building, and breaking things until the error messages start to sound familiar.
